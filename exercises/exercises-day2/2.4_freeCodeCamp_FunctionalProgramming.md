# Exercises Day 2 - freeCodeCamp Functional Programming

I did an attempt at the Functional Programming exercises from freeCodeCamp. I did find it very difficult because it contained quite a lot of things that I had never done before, so I decided to quit after a few exercises.              
I plan on going back and making them later on, in a couple of weeks, when I have learned more about JavaScript.

Here is a picture of the exercises I did do.
