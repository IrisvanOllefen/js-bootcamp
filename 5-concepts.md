# Concepts such as Binding, Scope, Closures and Hoisting

## Binding and Scope
Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible. For bindinns defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole programâ€”you can refer to such bindings wherever you want. These are called global. But bindings created for function parameters or declared inside a function can be references only in that function, so they are known as local. Bindings declared with `let` and `const` are in fact local to the block that they are declared in, so if you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot "see" it.
